* HelloXL - a simple sample ReactJS project to learn from.

** Overview.

There's a wealth of introductory React material out there, much of it
is wonderful.  There's even great tools, like [[https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app][create-react-app]] that
will set up a new React app for you.  The intent of this repository is
not *that*.  It is rather intended to be used to give new comers a
quick tour of what a React application looks like, from the code point
of view.  It is inherently trivial. 

** Prerequisites
*** Setting up or Linux computer
If you're on Arch linux, Ubuntu or Red Hat / Centos, this projects
Makefile should be able to set up everything you need.  Be warned that
this will result in Docker and Go being installed on your machine.

*** Setting up on Mac

**** 1. Install HomeBrew

If you already have HomeBrew, you can skip this.  The following should
all be carried out in a terminal/console.

First install homebrew
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
#+END_SRC

Then update HomeBrew's repository
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew update
#+END_SRC

Then use a text editor to add the following to your =~/.bash_profile= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
#+END_SRC

Finally you'll need to source your bash profile:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
. ~/.bash_profile
#+END_SRC

**** 2. Install NodeJS
Using HomeBrew you can now install NodeJS.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install node

**** TODO 
#+END_SRC

**** 3. Install Go
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install go
#+END_SRC

**** 4. Optionally install Docker for Mac
If you want to install docker on your mac, and run this in a linux container, then [[https://www.docker.com/docker-mac][follow these instructions.]]

*** Setting up on Windows

Follow the instructions [[http://dilbert.com/strip/1995-06-24][here]].  Seriously though, the secret is to bang the rocks together guys.

** Running helloxl.

If all the above works out correclty, you should be able to just run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make
#+END_SRC

.. and wait for that to finish.  You should then run the tests to see
that everything is working as expected:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make test
#+END_SRC

Finally you have a choice - either run the app locally, or run it from
a docker container.

*** Running locally
If all the above steps worked you simply need to run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./helloxl
#+END_SRC

.. and point your browser to http://localhost:3000 to see the
application running.

*** Running in a docker container

If you installed docker, then you can also:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make docker-run
#+END_SRC

.. this will trigger the building of a new docker image, and
eventually start it, mapping the containers port 3000 to localhost's
port 8080.  Therefore when it's done, you should be able to access the
app at [[http://localhost:8080]].
